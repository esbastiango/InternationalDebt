# InternationalDebt

## Overview
This project analyzes international debt data provided by the World Bank. Countries often take on debt not only to address immediate needs but also to manage their economies and fund long-term development projects, such as infrastructure. The World Bank and other multilateral creditors are key sources of financial support for developing nations.

The dataset used in this project contains detailed information on the debt amounts (in USD) owed by various countries. This analysis aims to explore the dataset and answer key questions related to debt disbursements, interest rates, and repayment patterns of different nations.

## Objectives
The project is structured around four key objectives:

### Exploring the Dataset: 
Analyzing the structure and key variables within the dataset to better understand the data provided.
### Countries with the Highest Disbursement by Multilateral Creditors:
Identifying the countries that have received the highest disbursements of debt from multilateral creditors.
### Interest Rates of Multilateral Institutions:
Analyzing the interest rates charged by multilateral institutions across various countries.
### Top Countries by Repayments: 
Examining which countries are making the largest repayments on long-term debt.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following key variables:

country_name: The name of the country.
indicator_code: The code corresponding to various indicators (e.g., disbursements, repayments, interest payments).
debt: The value of debt in USD associated with a given indicator for a country.

## Source
This project is based on the DataCamp project "Analyze International Debt Statistics". You can access the original project here.

## Conclusion
This analysis will provide insights into how countries manage their debt, which countries are making the highest repayments, and how multilateral creditors impact global debt dynamics.
